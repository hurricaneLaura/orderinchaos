Many centuries ago... Gods ruled the world and the demons were kept at bay. There was peace.
The monkey-king was born into this age.
Some say he was mightiest of all gods with power and skills beyond imagining.
Then, everything changed. The monkey-king was lostâ€¦ banished by his enemies, never to return.
Peace was disrupted and all goodness was forced into hiding and the demons took over.
700 years later... chaos rules. All gods are gone.
The only thing faith left, is the belief that one day the chosen one with come forward to seek out the monkey-king.
That time is now!
It is time to find the monkey-king.
There are 2 sacred scrolls known to possess great power.
To free the monkey king and gain enough power to overthrow all the demons,
the scrolls MUST be gathered and taken to the monkey king.
